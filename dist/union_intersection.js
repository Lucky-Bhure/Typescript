//todo Homework Question By Thapa Technical: Combine User and Account Data
//todo You are building a user management system, and you have two TypeScript types:
//? User: Represents basic user information, with the following properties:
//? id (number): The user's unique identifier.
//? name (string): The user's name.
//? email (string): The user's email address.
//? Account: Contains details about the user's account, with the following properties:
//? accountId (number): The account's unique identifier.
//? accountType (string): The type of the account (e.g., "Savings", "Checking", etc.).
//? balance (number): The account balance.
//* Your task is to create a function called combineUserAndAccount that takes a User object and an Account object as arguments and returns a new object representing the combined information of the user and their account.
// Ensure that the resulting object contains all the properties from both User and Account types.
